# CryptoColabCode
This repository contains Python notebooks and scripts for performing technical analysis on cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC), Binance Coin (BNB), and Ripple (XRP). The notebooks leverage various technical indicators and machine learning models like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to predict market trends and analyze price movements. With the ease of Google Colab, these tools can be accessed and run directly in the cloud without the need for complex local setups. Whether you're a trader or an analyst, this project offers a hands-on approach to understanding cryptocurrency markets through data analysis and technical indicators.
